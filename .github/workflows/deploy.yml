# CI/CD Pipeline - Automatically tests and builds our app
name: CI/CD Pipeline

# Trigger: When code is pushed to main OR pull request to main
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# Jobs run in order: test FIRST, then build (if tests pass)
jobs:
  # JOB 1: Run Tests
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use GitHub's Ubuntu server

    steps:
      # Step 1: Download code from GitHub repo
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Install Python 3.11
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      # Step 3: Install Flask and pytest
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r app/requirements.txt
          pip install pytest

      # Step 4: Run our tests (if ANY fail, pipeline stops here!)
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest tests/ -v

  # JOB 2: Build Docker Image (only runs if "test" job passes)
  build:
    needs: test # Wait for "test" job to succeed
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Download code again (each job is separate)
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Build Docker image with commit hash as tag
      # github.sha = unique commit ID (e.g., abc123)
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t flask-app:${{ github.sha }} ./app

      # Step 3: Test the Docker image works
      - name: Test Docker image
        run: |
          docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name test-container flask-app:${{ github.sha }}
          sleep 5  # Wait for container to start
          curl http://localhost:5000 || exit 1  # Test endpoint (exit 1 = fail)
          docker stop test-container  # Clean up

# In production, you'd add a 3rd job: "deploy" to push to AWS/cloud
